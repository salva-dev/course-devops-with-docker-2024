# Course devops-with-docker (exercises)

Each exercise content (files) is in its corresponding folder. The name of each exercise's folder starts with the exercise's number.

In the submitted file exercises consisting of commands and outputs (named commands-and-output.txt), I have followed the following nomenclature:
```
# # Comments 
# commands
(nothing) output of the commands
```
