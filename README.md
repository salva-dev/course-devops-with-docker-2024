# Course devops-with-docker (exercises)

Each exercise content (files) is in its corresponding folder. The name of each exercise's folder starts with the exercise's number.

In the exercises with submitted file consisting of commands and outputs (named commands-and-output.txt), I've followed the following nomenclature:
```
# Comments 
$ commands
(nothing) output of the commands
```
